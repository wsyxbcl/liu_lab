Electrochemical Biosensor for MicroRNA Detection Based on Cascade Hybridization Chain Reaction  
Meijuan Liang, Min Pan, Jialing Hu, Fuan Wang, and Xiaoqing Liu*  
The development of effective strategies for sensitive and specific detection of microRNAs will facilitate clinical diagnostics. Here, we utilize cascade hybridization chain reaction as an enzyme-free isothermal amplified strategy, and construct label-free electrochemical biosensors for microRNA assay. MicroRNA initiated autonomous assembly of DNA nanostructures through the toehold-mediated strand displacement reaction. The assembly behavior was examined by gel electrophoresis and morphology of branched DNA nanostructure was verified by atomic force microscope. This cascade hybridization chain reaction leads to extended growth of DNA chains and higher amplification efficiency compared with the regular hybridization chain.

The website was designed using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and framework was based on [bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)

The framework was heavily inspired by [Trevor Bedford's website](http://bedford.io/) and [Riggleman's lab website](http://rrgroup.seas.upenn.edu/), which save so much time. 
The souce code is open-sourced on [Github](https://github.com/wsyxbcl/liu_lab), feel free to fork.
